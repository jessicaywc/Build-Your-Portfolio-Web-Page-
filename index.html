      <h2> Hi, my name is Jessica! </h2>
     
      <p> I'm originally from South Korea but I'm currently living in Southern California. I'm very excited to learn the ins and outs of software engineering. </p>

           <!-- A description that shows your passion for web development and your willingness to work with others. One or two sentences that describe other interests you have outside of web development-->
        <p> I used to work in finance for five years before taking on the challenge of becoming a software engineer. The finance     
            world was great but I always craved a more collaborative and creative field of work. I've made the leap to learn a new 
            skill and I know I'm in great hands at Thinkful! </p>
        
           <p>  I know being a software engineer will be challenging, but I want to learn from my peers and make meaningful 
            contributions to project we're building together! </p> 
        <!--use the "ul" function -->
        <p> When I'm not infront of my computer studying, I love to:
          <ul>
            <li>Go to concerts</li>
            <li>Travel anywhere and everywhere </li>
            <li>Go to art museums</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
